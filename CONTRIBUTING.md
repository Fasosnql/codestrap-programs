# Contributing
If you are interested in contributing that's awesome! I need your help.
- Fork the repo.
- Make your changes.
- Issue a pull request. Be sure you perform the required quality checks.
- Do not include copyrighted material! I know it's tempting to copy paste. I've done it. Just don't do it.

# Collaborating
If you want to become a project collaborator issue a meaningful PR first. After you've
contributed I'll consider adding you to the project.
